# Phoenix Doan's Website 
> For the project, I worked on building my own personal website as a portfolio. I learned to create a landing page for myself on the Internet. With this, I learned to configure a Google Analytics campaign and link the page to a custom domain, as well as add my SSL certificate.


## General Information
- The purpose of this project was to apply all the knowledge I've learned in my Digital Product Management class. 
- This will help me present actual work to future employers I will be interviewing for. 


## Technologies Used
- Vanilla JavaScript App through [Azure Static Web Apps.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview)
- Allows you to easily build JavaScript apps in minutes.
- Used this repo with the [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started?tabs=vanilla-javascript) to build and customize a new static site.
- This repo is used as a starter for a _very basic_ HTML web application using no front-end frameworks.

## What I Learned
- Have my site deployed from a GitHub pipeline successfully.
- How to configure an SSL certificate for my website.
- Configured a Google Analytics account and add the tracking code.
